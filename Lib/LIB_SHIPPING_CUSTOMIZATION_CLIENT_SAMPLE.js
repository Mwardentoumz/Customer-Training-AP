                 * 		This user exit is typically used to customize:
                 * 			Objects from the included script libraries.
                 * 			Objects from the HTML page script.
                 * 			Form controls and their visibility, read-only state, or requirements.
                 * @since 343
                 * @returns {Promise<void>}
                 * @example
                 * The following user exit hides the TrackingNumber__ field and makes ShippingNote__ mandatory.
